# **Python Samples**

## Here are listed the python programs along with a brief overview of what they're supposed to do:

```
python image-to-array.py
```
> This program is a small demo that shows how the library `Pillow` can convert images to arrays and then save them. It is dependent on `pip install --user Pillow`
